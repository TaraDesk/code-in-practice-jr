# CodeInPractice

Welcome to the **CodeInPractice** repository! This is where I share my solutions to various Frontend Masters challenges that I have worked on. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning journey, highlight the solutions I’ve built, and demonstrate my approach to solving real-world frontend problems. 

I’ll be updating this repository as I complete new challenges, so feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to any of the solutions!
